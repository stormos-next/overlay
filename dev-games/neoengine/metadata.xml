		NeoEngine is built with platform and API independency as the main goal.
		This means that if you build your game using the NeoEngine abstractions
		for services such as rendering, audio, file/resource management and
		networking, your game will run on all NeoEngine supported platforms with
		no changes to your game code. NeoEngine is also designed with an "open"
		API in mind. This means you can easily change, remove or add components
		you wish.
