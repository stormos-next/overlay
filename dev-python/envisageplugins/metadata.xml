    The EnvisagePlugins project from the Enthought Tool Suite 
    includes a number of plug-ins for the Envisage framework that
    Enthought has found useful for building scientific
    applications. Envisage does not require that you use these
    plug-ins, but you may find them useful to avoid having to reinvent
    these particular wheels: 
    * Workbench: Provides an application GUI window that supports
      views and perspectives, similar to the Eclipse IDE.
    * Action: Supports user-interaction command mechanisms, such as
      toolbars, menus, and buttons.
    * Single Project: Supports a project paradigm for saving
      application data, assuming an interaction model in which only
      one project can be open in the application at a time.
    * Text Editor: Provides a rudimentary text editor interface.
    * Python Shell: Provides an interactive Python shell within a
      Workbench-based application.
    * Debug: Provides the Frame Based Inspector from the ETSDevTools
      project as an Envisage plug-in
