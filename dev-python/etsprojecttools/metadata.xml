    Enthought Tool Suite ProjectTools provides commands to make it
    easier for developers to work on projects that have a large number
    of dependencies, such as the ETS project itself. These commands
    are all predicated on a concept we call a "checkout", which is the
    coherent set of projects and versions that are required to satisfy
    all documented dependencies for the user-requested project(s).
