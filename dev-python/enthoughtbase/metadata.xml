    The EnthoughtBase project includes a few core packages that are used
    by many other projects in the Enthought Tool Suite:
    * enthought.etsconfig: Supports configuring settings that need to
      be shared across multiple projects or programs on the same
      system. Most significant of these is the GUI toolkit to be
      used. You can also configure locations for writing application
      data and user data, and the name of the company responsible for
      the software (which is used in the application and user data
      paths on some systems).
    * enthought.logger: Provides convenience functions for creating
      logging handlers.
    * enthought.util: Provides miscellaneous utility functions
