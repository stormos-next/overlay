  +talos+-1.2009.1013.14.ebuild, +files/rama+.patch, +metadata.xml:
  TALOS+ is largely based on the same concept as the original TALOS program,
  and now exploits a larger database of 200 proteins, but more importantly
  it includes a neural network component whose output is used as an
  additional empirical term in the conventional TALOS database search. The
  neural network component of the program relies on a well established
  computational framework that optimizes the relation between a large number
  of input variables derived from amino acid types and chemical shifts, and
  the area of the Ramachandran map where the residue is likely to reside.
