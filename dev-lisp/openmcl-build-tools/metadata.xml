<longdescription>
OpenMCL is a Common Lisp implementation. It began as a subset of the commercial
MCL (Macintosh Common Lisp), and has grown into a full-featured, stable
implementation. All of OpenMCL is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License. Commercial MCL does have a nicely integrated IDE and user interface
libraries, which were not open-sourced and are not available in OpenMCL.

This port contains the heap image and other tools for building OpenMCL (OpenMCL
needs an OpenMCL heap image to build itself).
