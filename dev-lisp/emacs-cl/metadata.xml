<longdescription>
  Emacs Common Lisp is an implementation of Common Lisp written in Emacs Lisp.
  That means you can run Common Lisp programs in Emacs, and you can write
  Emacs extensions in Common Lisp. At this stage, much of ANSI Common Lisp is
  implemented, but, among other things, CLOS and pretty printing are missing.
