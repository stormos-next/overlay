  Statsmodels is a python package that provides a complement to scipy
  for statistical computations including descriptive statistics and
  estimation of statistical models.
  scikits.statsmodels provides classes and functions for the estimation
  of several categories of statistical models. These currently include
  linear regression models, OLS, GLS, WLS and GLS with AR(p) errors,
  generalized linear models for six distribution families,
  M-estimators for robust linear models, and regression with discrete
  dependent variables, Logit, Probit, MNLogit, Poisson, based on
  maximum likelihood estimators. An extensive list of result
  statistics are avalable for each  estimation problem.
