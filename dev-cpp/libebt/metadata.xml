		The libebt library provides a clean way of getting human-readable
		backtrace messages in C++. It uses the RAII (resource acquisition is
		initialisation) idiom to manage backtrace stack items. libebt is a pure
		template library, so there is no need to link your application against
		anything. libebt is installed into the standard include path, so no
		CXXFLAGS are needed either.
