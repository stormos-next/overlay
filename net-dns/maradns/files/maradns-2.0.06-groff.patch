Subject: Fix error in the man pages
 This is really ugly. The man pages are generated by a custom text processing
 system from filesin the doc/en/source directory. Therefore really this
 needs to be fixed in the upstream 'ej' utility. It would be better to patch
 that and submit that patch upstream.
