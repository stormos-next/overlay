Starting with catalyst 2.0.10.1, make.conf and make.profile will be
moved from /etc to /etc/portage. This is a change in the installation
defaults and may impact anyone using custom / automated methods to do
Gentoo installations. If you use catalyst, be sure to check if you
need to update your installation method(s).
The 2.0.11 version finally provides support for using xz snapshots.
Catalyst nows prefers xz over bz2 snapshots.
