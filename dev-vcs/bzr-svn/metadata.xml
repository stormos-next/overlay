	bzr-svn is a plugin that allows Bazaar direct access to Subversion
	repositories. It allows most bzr commands to work directly against
	Subversion repositories, as if you were using bzr with a native bzr
	repository.

	The plugin can at the moment be used to commit to, pull from, merge from,
	push to and view logs of Subversion branches from Bazaar.

	It also provides a Bazaar subcommand ("bzr svn-import") for converting
	complete Subversion repositories to Bazaar repositories.
